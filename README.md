# House_Price_Prediction

## Overview

This project predicts house prices using machine learning. The model is trained on a dataset with features like house size, number of rooms, and location to estimate the price.

## Dataset

- Contains information on house attributes (size, bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.).
- Includes location-based and market-related details.

## Technologies Used

- Python, Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
